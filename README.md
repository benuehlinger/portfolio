### Reverse-Engineering CMS Star Algorithm  
*(Dec 2024 ‚Äì Dec 2024, William & Mary Capstone)*

- The **hospital star rating** is a critical metric for evaluating healthcare quality, representing a composite score based on patient outcomes, safety, and care standards. As part of a three-person team, led efforts to **reverse-engineer** the hospital star rating system for Riverside Hospital.  
- Architected a **robust staging database** in AWS MySQL to house extensive historical measure score data (e.g., mortality, safety of care) spanning back to 2017.  
- Leveraged publicly available code and data to fully **replicate the star rating algorithm** in Python, ensuring high accuracy and transparency through validation.  
- Applied **machine learning techniques** to analyze the effect of individual measures on the star rating, pinpointing key areas for strategic improvement to enhance Riverside Hospital‚Äôs rating and overall care quality.  
- **Impact**: Provided actionable insights, empowering the hospital to implement targeted enhancements and better meet quality benchmarks. Used ML and group scores to identify key areas of improvement for Riverside.
